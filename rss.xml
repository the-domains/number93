            <title><![CDATA[The US Election 2016]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The US Election 2016</h1><p>The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the US election would mean that, for the first time in history (I think), the Commander-in-Chief of the US military would not have the respect of their senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there be a military coup in North America? Well, as crazy as that sounds, if Mr Trump is a hands on President, it's not totally out of the question. Mr Trump isn’t known for his calm temperament or empathy for others and he certainly doesn’t forgive. All things that I would think make a good leader. It's one thing to fire someone from a boardroom table but another thing all together to order people be fired at.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4665a219-8754-437d-9ee4-67bf3577dd2c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>We are here.</h1><p>I love this painting. The atmosphere and the girl's lack of fear as the strangers emerge makes the piece rather tense.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Husband writes defiant tribute to his wife killed in Bataclan massacre</h1><p>I will not give you the gift of hating you. You have obviously sought it but responding to hatred with anger would be to give in to the same ignorance that that has made you what you are. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d13c452a6f37009018f970da382118d646474f77.jpg"></article>]]></description>
