  The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the
  US election would mean that for the first time in history (I think), the
  Commander-in-Chief of the US military would not have the respect of their
  senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there
  be a military coup in North America? Well as crazy as that sounds should Mr
  Trump be a hands on President it's not out of the question. Mr Trump has,
  throughout his career, not been know to possess a calm temperament or express
  any empathy for others. It's one thing to fire someone from a boardroom table
  but another thing all together to order people be fired at from a military
  situation room.

The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the US election would mean that for the first time in history (I think), the Commander-in-Chief of the US military would not have the respect of their senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there be a military coup in North America? Well as crazy as that sounds should Mr Trump be a hands on President it's not out of the question. Mr Trump has, throughout his career, not been know to possess a calm temperament or express any empathy for others. It's one thing to fire someone from a boardroom table but another thing all together to order people be fired at from a military situation room.

Or perhaps he'll run the country like he does all of his other enterprises, in name only. This will, as it has in the past, provide Mr Trump with a convenient excuse when his presidency fails to live up to the astonishing rhetoric of his campaign. So next year when we all ask why the wall's not built, why the border isn't locked down and why all those jobs for middle America have not come home, you can expect the same tired excuse "It's not my fault, I just sold the Republicans the rights to use my name."

I remember when another Donald decried Europe as old. Well if Europe is old then the USA has become one of those irritating teenagers who in an adrenalin charged game of chicken keep sticking their head out the speeding train window. The rest of the world all know that at some point the passing poles will win, and we'll be left cleaning up all of the blood and bones.
