  The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the
  US election would mean that, for the first time in history (I think), the
  Commander-in-Chief of the US military would not have the respect of their
  senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there
  be a military coup in North America? Well, as crazy as that sounds, if Mr
  Trump is a hands on President, it's not totally out of the question. Mr Trump
  isn’t known for his calm temperament or empathy for others and he certainly
  doesn’t forgive. All things that I would think make a good leader. It's one
  thing to fire someone from a boardroom table but another thing all together to
  order people be fired at.

The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the US election would mean that, for the first time in history (I think), the Commander-in-Chief of the US military would not have the respect of their senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there be a military coup in North America? Well, as crazy as that sounds, if Mr Trump is a hands on President, it's not totally out of the question. Mr Trump isn't known for his calm temperament or empathy for others and he certainly doesn't forgive. All things that I would think make a good leader. It's one thing to fire someone from a boardroom table but another thing all together to order people be fired at.

Perhaps won't, perhaps he'll run the country like he does all of his other enterprises, in name only. This will, as it has in the past, provide Mr Trump with a convenient excuse when his presidency fails to live up to the astonishing rhetoric of his campaign. Next year when we all ask why the Mexican wall's not built, why the US border isn't locked down and why all those jobs for middle America haven't materialised, you can expect the same old excuse...

I remember when another Donald decried Europe as old. Well if Europe is old then the USA has become one of those irritating teenagers who, in an adrenalin charged game of chicken, keeps sticking their head out of the speeding train window. While the rest of the world are stuck sitting, waiting, knowing that at some point those poles flashing past will win and when they do we'll be left cleaning up all blood and bones fragments... again.
