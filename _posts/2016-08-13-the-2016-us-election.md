  The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the
  US election suddenly creates an environment where, for the first time in
  history the Commander-in-Chief of the US military will not have the respect of
  senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there
  be a military coup in North America? Well as crazy as that sounds if he's a
  hands on President it's not out of the question.

The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the US election suddenly creates an environment where, for the first time in history the Commander-in-Chief of the US military will not have the respect of senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there be a military coup in North America? Well as crazy as that sounds if he's a hands on President it's not out of the question.

Or perhaps he'll run the country like he does all of his other enterprises, in name only. This will, as it has in the past, provide Mr Trump with a convenient excuse when his presidency fails to live up to the astonishing rhetoric in his campaign. So next year when we all ask why the wall's not built, why the border isn't locked down and why all those jobs for middle America have not come home, you can expect the same tired excuse "It's not my fault, I just sold the Republicans the right to use my name."

I remember when another Donald decried Europe as old. Well if Europe is old then the USA has become one of those irritating teenagers who in an adrenalin charged game of chicken keep sticking their head out the speeding train window. We all know that at some point the passing poles will win.
