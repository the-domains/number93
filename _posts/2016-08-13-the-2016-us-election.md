  The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the
  US election would mean that for the first time in history (I think), the
  Commander-in-Chief of the US military would not have the respect of their
  senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there
  be a military coup in North America? Well as crazy as that sounds if Mr Trump
  is a hands on President it's not totally out of the question. Mr Trump isn’t
  known for his calm temperament or empathy for others and he certainly doesn’t
  forgive. All things that I think make a good leader. It's one thing to fire
  someone from a boardroom table but another thing all together to order people
  be fired at.

The possibility of Donald Trump being President of the United States after the US election would mean that for the first time in history (I think), the Commander-in-Chief of the US military would not have the respect of their senior military and intelligence staff. Which raises the question, could there be a military coup in North America? Well as crazy as that sounds if Mr Trump is a hands on President it's not totally out of the question. Mr Trump isn't known for his calm temperament or empathy for others and he certainly doesn't forgive. All things that I think make a good leader. It's one thing to fire someone from a boardroom table but another thing all together to order people be fired at.

Or perhaps he'll run the country like he does all of his other enterprises, in name only. This will, as it has in the past, provide Mr Trump with a convenient excuse when his presidency fails to live up to the astonishing rhetoric of his campaign. So next year when we all ask why the wall's not built, why the border isn't locked down and why all those jobs for middle America have not come home, you can expect the same tired excuse...

I remember when another Donald decried Europe as old. Well if Europe is old then the USA has become one of those irritating teenagers who in an adrenalin charged game of chicken keeps sticking their head out of the speeding train window. The rest of the world sit and watch knowing that at some point the passing poles will win, and we'll all be left cleaning up all blood and bones.
